```Please ensure that Salesforce Communities is available in your org prior to installing```

1. [Install from salesforce.org - login with a scratch org](https://install.salesforce.org/products/grants-management/1.7/install-and-build-community)

2. For some reasons, I could't login to scratch org when installing PMM. It worked this time.
